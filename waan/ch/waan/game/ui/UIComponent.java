/**
 * A basic UI Component.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this interface may be very flexible, is however subject
 * to a few rules. It is recommended to follow these rules in any implementation
 * to ensure correct behaviour. The rules are the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The position may be changed at any time. Any such change will be applied
 * at the next graphics tick.
 * <li>The dimension should not be changed once the component has been added to
 * a container. Some containers may rely on the dimension of their child
 * components for proper operation.
 * <li>A component will be notified about any relevant changes in the parent
 * container. This includes adding or removing the component to the parent, but
 * also changes in the size of the parent.
 * <li>A parent may perform collision checks at any time. Collision checks are
 * used to determine whether or not the mouse is currently "on" the component.
 * <li>Obsolete components should always be removed from their parent container,
 * since the retained references will prevent garbage collection and increase
 * rendering times.
 * </ul>
 *
